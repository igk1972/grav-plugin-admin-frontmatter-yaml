# Admin Frontmatter Yaml Plugin

The **Admin Frontmatter Yaml** Plugin is for [Grav CMS](http://github.com/getgrav/grav). Support saving frontmatter.yaml files in Admin plugin.

Just install Grav core, Grav Admin, and admin-frontmatter-yaml.

You can specify the names of the top level of the yaml blocks in the plugin settings.

You donâ€™t have to do anything else.
When saving to Grav Admin, file frontmatter.yaml will be created.


## Installation

Installing the Admin Frontmatter Yaml plugin can be done in one of two ways. The GPM (Grav Package Manager) installation method enables you to quickly and easily install the plugin with a simple terminal command, while the manual method enables you to do so via a zip file.

### GPM Installation (Preferred)

The simplest way to install this plugin is via the [Grav Package Manager (GPM)](http://learn.getgrav.org/advanced/grav-gpm) through your system's terminal (also called the command line).  From the root of your Grav install type:

    bin/gpm install admin-frontmatter-yaml

This will install the Admin Frontmatter Yaml plugin into your `/user/plugins` directory within Grav. Its files can be found under `/your/site/grav/user/plugins/admin-frontmatter-yaml`.

### Manual Installation

To install this plugin, just download the zip version of this repository and unzip it under `/your/site/grav/user/plugins`. Then, rename the folder to `admin-frontmatter-yaml`. You can find these files on [GitHub](https://github.com/igk1972/grav-plugin-admin-frontmatter-yaml) or via [GetGrav.org](http://getgrav.org/downloads/plugins#extras).

You should now have all the plugin files under

    /your/site/grav/user/plugins/admin-frontmatter-yaml

> NOTE: This plugin is a modular component for Grav which requires [Grav](http://github.com/getgrav/grav) and the [Error](https://github.com/getgrav/grav-plugin-error) and [Problems](https://github.com/getgrav/grav-plugin-problems) to operate.

### Admin Plugin

If you use the admin plugin, you can install directly through the admin plugin by browsing the `Plugins` tab and clicking on the `Add` button.

## Configuration

Before configuring this plugin, you should copy the `user/plugins/admin-frontmatter-yaml/admin-frontmatter-yaml.yaml` to `user/config/plugins/admin-frontmatter-yaml.yaml` and only edit that copy.

Here is the default configuration and an explanation of available options:

```yaml
enabled: true
blocks: title,metadata,taxonomy
```

Note that if you use the admin plugin, a file with your configuration, and named admin-frontmatter-yaml.yaml will be saved in the `user/config/plugins/` folder once the configuration is saved in the admin.

## Usage

This plugin adds a function to contain non-localized header blocks in the frontmatter.yaml file.
Allows you to avoid duplication of common values, which are taken out in a single file.
The most frequent use - for sites with content in many languages.
